Here are the currently known bugs (feel free to contribute patches)


Poor feedback for some HTTP errors
----------------------------------

When an HTTP error occurs but isn't accompanied by explanatory text, there's
no feedback to the user

e.g. if the SPARQL HTTP server returns HTTP error code 501 but doesn't include
text or an HTML document explaining the error then only a blank line is shown.
Probably the HTTP error code should be returned in this case, and perhaps long
HTML error messages should be suppressed since the SPARQL client isn't able to
render them as intended anyway.
