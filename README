sparql-query is a command-line tool for accessing SPARQL endpoints over HTTP

It has been intentionally designed to 'feel' similar to tools for
interrogating SQL databases. It supports readline so that you can more easily
recall and edit previous queries, even across sessions. It can be used non-
interactively for example from a shell script. It doesn't have difficult or
hard to find dependencies so it should build fairly easily on typical Unix-like
systems.

You can find a list of some existing public SPARQL endpoints on the ESW wiki
http://esw.w3.org/topic/SparqlEndpoints

For example, to access the DBpedia endpoint, which contains knowledge
gleaned from Wikipedia, you would type:

sparql-query http://dbpedia.org/sparql
